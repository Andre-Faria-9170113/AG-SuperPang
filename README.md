# AG-SuperPang
Canvas-based game heavily inspired by the 1989 arcade game "Pang" (known as Buster Bros. in it's NA release by Capcom). This Project was developed as part of the "Animação Gráfica" course, integrated in the second year curriculum of the TSIW degree at ESMAD.

The main game is accompanied by a short introductory animation, made using Canvas and CSS animations, contained in a separate folder from the game.

## Prerequisites

-Any regular web browser (just keep in mind this was not developed with mobile devices in mind).

## Getting Started

-In order to view the intro animation, open the index.html page in the "animation" folder;

-To play the game itself, open the index.html page in the "PANG" folder;

-Click on the desired game-mode (single-player or 2-player coop-play);

-To beat the game, progress through 3 increasingly difficult levels by destroying all spheres on screen by having the playable character(s) fire harpoons at them, all while avoiding being hit by the spheres, otherwise the player will lose one of his 3 lives, and if he runs out of lives, a Game Over state is triggered.

## Player Controls

P - Pause/Unpause.

### Player 1
